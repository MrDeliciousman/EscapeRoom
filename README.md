It is an app that shows some images and written narration that presents scenarios that allows the user to experience a story that they can affect at certain junctions with two options.

## User Stories

1. I am a user that enjoys a thrilling story. I would like the app to tell an engaging story that I can be immersed in.

2. I am a user that likes to explore different paths in a game and see what the different ending are. I would enjoy the option to go back to previous junctions and choose other decisions so that I may see what the different paths lead to.
